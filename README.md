# BigInt
A class to perform precise computations with large integers

## Background
This was created as part of the ECE 218 Data Structures course I took in Spring 2018. The objective was to practice inheritance by implementing
a Big Int class which was based off of a vector of ints. Looking back, there is potential to improve the design, primarily by changing the
implementation to be based of vectors of characters (i.e. strings) to conserve space. I may plan to use this as an opportunity to practice
operator overloading as well.
